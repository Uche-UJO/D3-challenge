## Healthcare Disparity Project

### Problem
###### Create a webpage that displays the relationship between obesity levels and poverty levels in the US. Dataset is sourced from https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/searchresults.xhtml

Build an interative web application to help users quickly query ufo-sightings data (https://uche-ujo.github.io/UFO-project/UFO-level-1/static/js-folder/data.js) based on different input conditions and then return a data table. 

### Process
###### Create a basic HTML web page and design it with CSS and Bootstrap.

###### Write code that utilize Javascript to query ufo-sightings data (in form of an array of Javascript objects), append a table to web page and then add new rows of data for each UFO sighting. This code will listen for events and search through the arrays to find rows that match user input  Used the D3.select function to create filter and then subsequently created a table to contain the filtered data.

###### Website can search specific data (from the dataset) to match user's input.
